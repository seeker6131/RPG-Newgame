"""Animated effects from PixelLab's VFX artist (POST /vfx, 'lite' = about half a cent each).
Each result is a spritesheet + JSON (frames, durations, anchor); the game loads them as atlases (src/world/fx2.ts).
With `sprite` the effect is made around one of our objects (brazier fire sits in the bowl, the fountain sprays from its spout)
and the object is part of every frame.
python3 -I tools/gen_vfx2.py [key ...]   -> art-source/pixellab/vfx2/<key>.png/.json/.gif, copied to src/assets/td/fx/
The files come from api.pixellab.ai/mcp/... links (no auth); urllib is refused there, so they are fetched with curl.
